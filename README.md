# django-todo
using django, python and html to create todo app

to use it,

- open Terminal,
- change directory to folder
- start virtual environment
  pipenv shell
- start server 
  python manage.py runserver
- go to url given by terminal and add /todo/ 
  ie. http://127.0.0.1:8000/todo/

GitHub told me to upgrade my django version to 2.1.2 instead of 2.1 (i use django 2.1 to all my project till now)
if you use django 2.1.2 version or the newest, 
you should delete pipfile and pipfile.lock and then install django to get those file again

thanks
